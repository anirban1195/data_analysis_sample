This is a multi weekend project trying to extract some fun insights form the survey data of Stack Overflow. 

It has some basic statistical tests and some moderate level pandas data wrangling and finally some expected and some unexpected insights

See the ipynb file for the summary.

Note: Parts of the code were written using Gemini.
